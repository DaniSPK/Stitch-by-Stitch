    <section class="AboutText">
    <h1 class="Text">Stitch by Stitch is a local South Florida business started by a young entrepreneur who one day wishes to be a fashion designer. Our owner’s first contact with a sewing machine was in first grade, when she made her costume for a play she was participating in at her school. Later on, she had classes with a friend’s grandmother and later had classes at Petite Designers™ with another friend.</h1>
        <h1 class="Text">When Covid hit, she stopped classes and Petite Designers™ asked their students to make face masks for the Memorial Hospitals. After this collaboration, our owner started making masks for her family and friends, but soon noticed how uncomfortable the regular masks are. This is when she discovered five dart masks. She made many, and started selling them, with other products like scrunchies, pouches, doggy boots, and others. We hope you enjoy shopping, as stated in Our Mission, we want to make you the most comfortable products, that are also safe for the environment.</h1>

        <h1 class="Text">Our mission is to create the most comfortable and reusable, fabric based handmade products for you, the person you help by buying a mask and most importantly, safe for the environment. In the pandemic that we are living through, our planet has suffered greatly with our careless disposing of plastic masks and other utensils that help us not spread covid. According to PBS (Sy and Baldwin), every month we use around 129 billion plastic masks every month, and around 3 million are thrown out every minute. That is just 0.9 less than the searches done on Google every minute. (Skai) In an interview that Stephanie Sy had with Maria Algarra (foundress of Clean this Beach Up in Miami), Maria says that every cleanup they do they can find around 50-100 masks near the shoreline. She states that “It's not just about the fact that masks are not biodegradable or recyclable. It's about the fact that they are a hazard for our wildlife, not just because they can eat the mask, but also because animals get entangled in the straps.” While searching, Algarra and her team found a pufferfish trapped with the mask’s elastic, they have seen some birds and marine life eating them.
