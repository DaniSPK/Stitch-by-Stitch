    <section class="AboutText">
    <h1 class="Text">Stitch by Stitch is a local South Florida business started by a young entrepreneur who is working to become one day into a fashion designer. Our foundress' first contact with a sewing machine was in 1<sup><u>st</u></sup> Grade, when she made her costume for a play she was participating in at her school. Later on, she had classes with a friend’s grandmother that she later complemented with some additional classes at Petite Designers™ Sewing and Fashion Design School with another friend.</h1>
        <h1 class="Text">When Covid hit, she stopped the face-to-face classes. That is when Petite Designers™ asked their students to make face masks for the Memorial Hospitals. After collaborating with this initiative and sewing around 200 masks that she donated to her local church for the children that were going to celebrate their First Holy Communion in 2020, our foundress started making masks for her family and friends. Soon she noticed how uncomfortable the regular masks were.</h1> 
        <h1 class="Text">This is when she discovered the five dart masks. She made many and started selling them along with other products like scrunchies, pouches, doggy boots, among others. We look forward to hear from your shopping experience, which we hope is nice. As stated in Our Mission, we want to make you the most comfortable products, that are also safe for the environment.</h1>

        <h1 class="Text">When purchasing a mask, you are contributing to the preservation of the environment.</h1>
        <h1 class="Text">In this pandemic time, our planet is suffering greatly with our careless disposing of plastic masks and other utensils that help us contain the spread of COVID-19. According to PBS (Sy and Baldwin), every month we use around 129 billion plastic masks every month, and around 3 million are thrown out every minute. That is just 0.9 less than the searches done on Google every minute. (Skai)</h1> 
        <h1 class="Text">In an interview that Stephanie Sy had with Maria Algarra (foundress of Clean this Beach Up in Miami), Maria says that every cleanup they do they can find around 50-100 masks near the shoreline. She states that “it's not just about the fact that masks are not biodegradable or recyclable. It's about the fact that they are a hazard for our wildlife, not just because they can eat the mask, but also because animals get entangled in the straps.” While searching, Algarra and her team found a pufferfish trapped with the mask’s elastic, they have also seen some birds and marine life eating them.
